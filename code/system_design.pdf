Key Features of System Design
System design involves structuring and organizing software or hardware systems to ensure scalability, performance, reliability, and maintainability. Below are the key features:

1️⃣ Scalability 🚀
✔ Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out) – Adding more machines to handle load.
✔ Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up) – Increasing machine resources (CPU, RAM).( Buy bigger Machines )
✔ Load Balancing – Distributing traffic across multiple servers.

✅ Example: Large-scale systems like Netflix and Facebook use CDNs and microservices to handle millions of users efficiently.

2️⃣ Performance & Latency Optimization ⚡
✔ Caching – Storing frequently accessed data in Redis, Memcached.
✔ CDN (Content Delivery Network) – Reducing latency by serving static content from nearby locations.
✔ Efficient Database Indexing – Using B-Trees, Hash indexes, etc., for faster queries.

✅ Example: YouTube preloads video thumbnails & metadata using caching to reduce response time.

3️⃣ High Availability & Fault Tolerance 🔄
✔ Redundancy – Duplicating systems to avoid single points of failure.
✔ Replication – Using Master-Slave or Multi-Master database replication.
✔ Failover Mechanisms – Automatic switching to backup servers when failures occur.

✅ Example: Google Cloud and AWS use geo-redundant storage to ensure high availability.


4️⃣ Consistency & Data Integrity ✅
✔ CAP Theorem:

Consistency (C) – Every read gets the latest data.
Availability (A) – The system remains operational despite failures.
Partition Tolerance (P) – The system works across network failures.
✔ Eventual Consistency – Used in distributed databases like Cassandra.
✔ Strong Consistency – Used in traditional SQL databases.
✅ Example: Amazon DynamoDB uses eventual consistency for faster writes but offers strong consistency as an option.


5️⃣ Security & Privacy 🔐
✔ Authentication & Authorization – Using OAuth, JWT, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
✔ Data Encryption – Encrypting data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS/SSL).
✔ Rate Limiting & DDOS Protection – Using API Gateway, Cloudflare, etc.

✅ Example: Banking apps use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.


6️⃣ Microservices & API Design 🏗️
✔ RESTful & GraphQL APIs – Efficient communication between services.
✔ Service Discovery – Using Consul or Eureka for dynamic service registration.
✔ Inter-service Communication – gRPC, RabbitMQ, Kafka for message passing.

✅ Example: Uber uses microservices for ride-matching, payments, and notifications.

7️⃣ Database Design & Storage Systems 📂
✔ SQL vs NoSQL:

SQL (Relational) – MySQL, PostgreSQL for structured data.
NoSQL (Non-Relational) – MongoDB, DynamoDB for flexible schemas.
✔ Sharding & Partitioning – Dividing data across multiple servers.
✔ Data Warehousing – Storing analytical data in BigQuery, Snowflake.
✅ Example: Instagram uses PostgreSQL for relational data and Cassandra for user feeds.

8️⃣ Asynchronous Processing & Messaging Queues ⏳
✔ Message Brokers: Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ for async communication.
✔ Job Queues: Celery, Amazon SQS for background processing.
✔ Batch Processing: Spark, Hadoop for large-scale data jobs.

✅ Example: WhatsApp uses Kafka for message queuing to ensure reliable delivery.

9️⃣ Logging, Monitoring & Observability 📊
✔ Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd.
✔ Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana for real-time system metrics.
✔ Tracing: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry for request tracing in microservices.

✅ Example: Netflix uses Grafana and Prometheus for real-time monitoring.
